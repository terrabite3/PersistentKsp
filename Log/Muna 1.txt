Objective:
    Complete a manned mission to orbit the Mun. 
    Nobody dies.

This will be a simple manned Mun lander. After reaching LKO, the rest of the mission will use a single stage.

Post-mortem (literally)

Double and triple check times! I thought I was time-synched while approaching re-entry, but I was actually an hour behind. I realized my mistake at 20 minutes before re-entry. The craft exploded because the heat shield was not on the leading edge of the capsule.

Hofstadter's Law - Bring more fuel than you think you will need, even after taking into account Hofstadter's Law. I had barely enough fuel, even after padding each stage and adding 400 m/s extra to the delta-v budget. 

The delta-v budgets from the subway map for landing are especially optimistic. They are probably assuming a suicide burn landing. Without the ability to revert, I am much more conservative about my landing strategy.

Instead of padding each stage and adding a buffer after all stages, add buffers to each stage in a separate column. It was difficult to keep track of how close to the budget I actual was. Put each substantial burn on a separate line.

Add lights to all future craft. It gets really dark in the shadow of a body, and it makes the craft look cooler.

Add everything remotely useful to action buttons. Document them in the mission log.

Avoid landing on a steep slope. Every slope is steeper than it looks from orbit.
