Eve 1
17:28 August 13th 2017

Fix staging (start engine before releasing clamps)
First stage is sufficient to reach LKO if ascent profile is improved.
    Apoapis 1213 km
    Periapsis 16 km
Add some extra LOX to offset boiloff in second stage
Add action groups for solar panels
Add lights
Figure out how to get Engineer Redux to understand NTO/Aerozine50
Add decoupler for landing
Add action group for enabling and disabling fin control
Probably don't need so much ablator
Three parachutes is plenty for the entire third stage. After decoupling, we only need one or two.
Detaching heat shield caused probe to explode. Looks like a collision problem.



Action groups

1   Toggle solar panels on transfer stage
2   Extend solar panels inside heat shield
3   Activate engine on transfer stage
4   Shutdown engine on transfer stage
5   Toggle ullage RCS thrusters

  - LOx         13,069 kg
  = Dry mass    28,936 kg

After launch stage
    Apoapsis    3937 km
    Periapsis     30 km
Be even more aggresive with the ascent profile!

After circularization burn
    Apoapsis            4143 km
    Periapsis           3800 km
Planned ejection burn    625 m/s

After Kerbin ejection burn
    Eve periapsis        352 km
    Enter Eve SOI      23:44 Tuesday, October 10th 2017
    Eve periapsis      15:30 Wednesday, October 11th 2017
    Leave Eve SOI       7:17 Thursday, October 12th 2017


Arrival:    Day 284 16:00



Notes:
Need more reaction wheel torque
Even more LOX - 200 more
Use docking ports for decouplers, to allow refueling, etc.
Move solar panels away from fins; there is an orientation where the fins block two of the panels, and third panel is at a right angle from the sun.
