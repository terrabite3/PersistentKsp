Test flight 1
17:28 August 13th 2017

Fix staging (start engine before releasing clamps)
First stage is sufficient to reach LKO if ascent profile is improved.
    Apoapis 1213 km
    Periapsis 16 km
Add some extra LOX to offset boiloff in second stage
Add action groups for solar panels
Add lights
Figure out how to get Engineer Redux to understand NTO/Aerozine50
Add decoupler for landing
Add action group for enabling and disabling fin control
Probably don't need so much ablator
Three parachutes is plenty for the entire third stage. After decoupling, we only need one or two.
Detaching heat shield caused probe to explode. Looks like a collision problem.



Action groups

1   Toggle solar panels on transfer stage
2   Extend solar panels inside heat shield
3   Activate engine on transfer stage
4   Shutdown engine on transfer stage
5   Toggle ullage RCS thrusters


Test flight 2
21:18 September 1st 2017

After launch stage
    Apoapsis    3937 km
    Periapsis     30 km
Be even more aggresive with the ascent profile!

Need more reaction wheel torque

After circularization burn
    Apoapsis            4143 km
    Periapsis           3800 km
Planned ejection burn    625 m/s
