# Minuet


## Minuet 1

Unmanned test

Main engine lost power after separating boosters.
Separated from launch stage.
Not enough thrust to make it to orbit.
Crashed.


## Minuet 2

Unmanned test

Some flight path aberrations.
Almost made it to orbit.

Move solar panels to the pod.
Test lights on pod -- they're flickering
Add batteries


## Minuet 3

Unmanned test

Ascent good

At apoapsis, the probe was no longer in communication. It did not regain communication until it had re-entered the atmosphere. At that time, the parachutes were deployed to prime the engines and the ascent was resumed. However, the parachutes failed to detach and the vehicle tipped. 

Minuet 3 crash landed on the surface of Kerbin. Miraculously, the pod survived the crash and was refurbished for Minuet 4.
